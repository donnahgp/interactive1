          <p> The unique profile of Diamond Head (Lē‘ahi) sits prominently near the eastern edge of Waikiki’s coastline. Hawaii’s most recognized landmark is known for its historic hiking trail, stunning coastal views, and military history. Diamond Head State Monument encompasses over 475 acres, including the interior and outer slopes of the crater.</p>
          <p> I picked Diamond Head as one of my favorite places in Honolulu because of the upwards trail to the top of the mountain. It's a fairly easy hike with a view of the city and ocean at the top. I recommend going there as early as 6AM, before it gets hot and crowded!
