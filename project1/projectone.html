      <h1>1. What's an anime?</h1>
      <p>My first anime experience started in the early 2000’s when my friend talked about a show called Princess Tutu, with cat teaching ballet. She introduced me to my TV's On Demand function where we would end up watching the show together. It was the first time I heard about anime and I ended up loving it. Ever since then, I would end up watching anime using the On Demand function on my TV when my favorite cartoons weren’t on.
      <br>Some notable animes I watched during this time included Princess Tutu, Hell Girl, and Pokemon.</p>

      <h1>2. Library DVDs</h1>
      <p>After discovering anime, I wanted to see if my library had anime DVDs I could borrow and watch. This is where I discovered my favorite anime at the time, Fushigi Yuugi. I would end up borrowing the same Fushigi Yuugi DVDs all the time.
      <br>The other anime I ended up getting DVDs was Cardcaptor Sakura! Although I don't remember finishing the first episode.</p>
