    <p> Honolulu, Hawaii is a nice break of pace away from San Francisco, the cold and windy city where I've lived all my life. The warm weather, blue skies, and deeper connection with nature is what I love about this city. There's tons of places to eat, relax, and hike all throughout the city, but from my limited time there, here's what I loved and would recommend for other people to visit when they go there! </p>

    <h1> Diamond Head </h1>
    <div class = "paragraph">
          <p> Diamond Head is a popular tourist destination for those who want an easy hike up a mountain. From the top, you can see the city of Honolulu and take pictures by the ocean. Although it can get a little windy and hot at the top, just bring some comfy shoes and youâ€™ll have a great time walking up there.</p>
          <p> I picked Diamond Head as one of my favorite places in Honolulu because of the upwards trail to the top of the mountain. It's a fairly easy hike with a view of the city and ocean at the top. I recommend going there as early as 6AM, before it gets hot and crowded!</p>

    <h1> Yogur Story </h1>
        <p>Yogur Story is a breakfast and brunch restaurant that started out as a soft serve yogurt place but has then expanded as a full scale two story restauraunt known for their fusion dishes.</p>
        <p>This place is one of my favorite restaurants in Honolulu, I recommend the Ube Pancakes and Taro Latte! Their specialty drinks always come in cute cups with faces on them.</p>

          <p> Although there are undoubtedly better beaches on the island of Oahu, it doesn't hurt to visit the beach that's right by all the city and shops. Watching the sunset here is the perfect way to end your day.</p>

          <p> A garden in the midst of busy downtown Honolulu? Yes!  And here at Foster Botanical Garden, visitors find a refreshing change from the chaos of the city. As the oldest of the Honolulu Botanical Gardens, Foster Garden displays a mature and impressive collection of tropical plants.</p>
          <p> There's a flower here called the Smelly Corpse Flower that apparently blooms anywhere between 2 and 12 years.Even though the thing smells so bad it draws many visitors to come and take a smell, to the point where the garden extends their hours for people to see (and smell).</p>
