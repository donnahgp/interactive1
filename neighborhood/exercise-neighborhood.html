    <br></br>
    If Oahu is the heart of Hawaii, then Honolulu is its racing pulse. In this cosmopolitan capital city, you’ll find everything from historic landmarks to fine dining to world-class shopping. Home to the majority of Oahu’s population, Honolulu stretches across the southeastern shores of the island, from Pearl Harbor to Makapuu Point, encompassing world-famous Waikiki Beach along the way.
    <br></br>
    Honolulu is the capital and largest city of the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is an unincorporated part of and the county seat of the City and County of Honolulu along the southeast coast of the island of Oʻahu. The city is the main gateway to Hawaiʻi and a major portal into the United States. The city is also a major hub for international business, military defense, as well as being host to a diverse variety of east-west and Pacific culture, cuisine, and traditions.
    Honolulu is the remotest city of its size in the world, and is the westernmost and southernmost major U.S. city. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau recognizes the approximate area commonly referred to as "City of Honolulu" (not to be confused with the "City and County") as a census county division (CCD). Honolulu is a major financial center of the islands and of the Pacific Ocean. The population of the Honolulu census designated place (CDP) was 359,870 as of the 2017 population estimate, while the Honolulu CCD was 390,738 and the population of the consolidated city and county was 953,207.

    <h1> Diamond Head </h1>

    <h2>State Park</h2>
      <img src="assets/DiamondHead.jpg" alt="DiaHead" height="500"><a>
          <p> The unique profile of Diamond Head (Lē‘ahi) sits prominently near the eastern edge of Waikiki’s coastline. Hawaii’s most recognized landmark is known for its historic hiking trail, stunning coastal views, and military history. Diamond Head State Monument encompasses over 475 acres, including the interior and outer slopes of the crater.</p>
          <p> I picked Diamond Head as one of my favorite places in Honolulu because of the upwards trail to the top of the mountain. It's a fairly easy hike with a view of the city and ocean at the top. I recommend going there as early as 6AM, before it gets hot and crowded!</p>

          <p> A garden in the midst of busy downtown Honolulu? Yes!  And here at Foster Botanical Garden, visitors find a refreshing change from the chaos of the city. As the oldest of the Honolulu Botanical Gardens, Foster Garden displays a mature and impressive collection of tropical plants. Some of the magnificent trees in this 14-acre garden were planted in the 1850s by Dr. William Hillebrand. They marked the beginning of a heritage that became The Honolulu Botanical Gardens.</p>
          <p> There's a flower here called the Smelly Corpse Flower that apparently blooms anywhere between 2 and 12 years.Even though the thing smells so bad it draws many visitors to come and take a smell, to the point where the garden extends their hours for people to see (and smell).</p>
          <p> Plan your visit and see some flowers <a href="https://www.honolulu.gov/cms-dpr-menu/site-dpr-sitearticles/568-foster-botanical-garden.html">here</a>.</p>

          <p> Located just a short 5-mile drive from downtown Honolulu, this lookout offers the some of the best views on Oahu. From here you can spot Kailua town as well as Kaneohe Bay and, of course, the breathtaking Ko'olau Mountains. One word of warning, however: The wind will literally knock you off your feet at this spot if you're not prepared, so take off your hats and hold on to the kids! Aside from its obvious beauty, this spot is the site of one of King Kamehameha's most gruesome victories.</p>
          <p> This lookout allows you to take a look at Honolulu from a tall mountain, it's a great place for taking pictures and enjoying the view, but it can get a little windy from time to time!.</p>
