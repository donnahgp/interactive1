    Honolulu, Hawaii is a nice break of pace away from San Francisco, the cold and windy city where I've lived all my life. The warm weather, blue skies, and deeper connection with nature is what I love about this city. There's tons of places to eat, relax, and hike all throughout the city, but from my limited time there, here's what I loved and would recommend for other people to visit when they go there!

    <h1> Diamond Head </h1>
    <a id = DiaHead> </a>
    <h2>State Park</h2>
      <img src="assets/DiamondHead.jpg" alt="DiaHead"><a>
          <p> The unique profile of Diamond Head (Lē‘ahi) sits prominently near the eastern edge of Waikiki’s coastline. Hawaii’s most recognized landmark is known for its historic hiking trail, stunning coastal views, and military history. Diamond Head State Monument encompasses over 475 acres, including the interior and outer slopes of the crater.</p>
          <p> I picked Diamond Head as one of my favorite places in Honolulu because of the upwards trail to the top of the mountain. It's a fairly easy hike with a view of the city and ocean at the top. I recommend going there as early as 6AM, before it gets hot and crowded!</p>

    <h1>Foster Botanical Garden </h1>
    <a id = BotGarden> </a>
    <h2>Garden</h2>
      <img src="assets/Garden.JPG" alt="BotGarden" ><a>
          <p> A garden in the midst of busy downtown Honolulu? Yes!  And here at Foster Botanical Garden, visitors find a refreshing change from the chaos of the city. As the oldest of the Honolulu Botanical Gardens, Foster Garden displays a mature and impressive collection of tropical plants. Some of the magnificent trees in this 14-acre garden were planted in the 1850s by Dr. William Hillebrand. They marked the beginning of a heritage that became The Honolulu Botanical Gardens.</p>
          <p> There's a flower here called the Smelly Corpse Flower that apparently blooms anywhere between 2 and 12 years.Even though the thing smells so bad it draws many visitors to come and take a smell, to the point where the garden extends their hours for people to see (and smell).</p>
          <p> Plan your visit and see some flowers <a href="https://www.honolulu.gov/cms-dpr-menu/site-dpr-sitearticles/568-foster-botanical-garden.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h2>Garden</h2>
      <img src="assets/Mountain.JPG" alt="NPMountain" ><a>
          <p> Located just a short 5-mile drive from downtown Honolulu, this lookout offers the some of the best views on Oahu. From here you can spot Kailua town as well as Kaneohe Bay and, of course, the breathtaking Ko'olau Mountains. One word of warning, however: The wind will literally knock you off your feet at this spot if you're not prepared, so take off your hats and hold on to the kids! Aside from its obvious beauty, this spot is the site of one of King Kamehameha's most gruesome victories.</p>
          <p> This lookout allows you to take a look at Honolulu from a tall mountain, it's a great place for taking pictures and enjoying the view, but it can get a little windy from time to time!.</p>
