    <h1> Diamond Head </h1>

    <h2>State Park</h2>

          <p> The unique profile of Diamond Head (Lē‘ahi) sits prominently near the eastern edge of Waikiki’s coastline. Hawaii’s most recognized landmark is known for its historic hiking trail, stunning coastal views, and military history. Diamond Head State Monument encompasses over 475 acres, including the interior and outer slopes of the crater.</p>
          <p> I picked Diamond Head as one of my favorite places in Honolulu because of the upwards trail to the top of the mountain. It's a fairly easy hike with a view of the city and ocean at the top. I recommend going there as early as 6AM, before it gets hot and crowded!</p>

        <p>Yogur Story is a breakfast and brunch restaurant that started out as a soft serve yogurt place but has then expanded as a full scale two story restauraunt known for their fusion dishes.</p>

          <img src="assets/Beach.JPG" alt="WaikikiBeach" height="500"><a>
              <p> One of the most well-known beaches on the planet, this 2-mile stretch of white sand and calm turquoise blue ocean fringed by towering high-rises and boutique resorts is located on the South Shore of Oahu.</p>
              <p> Although there are undoubtedly better beaches on the island of Oahu, it doesn't hurt to visit the beach that's right by all the shops. Watching the sunset here is the perfect way to end your day.
